# Mazemaker3D
Blender Addon: Generate a cuboid 3D maze, or use an existing mesh to "fill" with a 3D maze form. Manifold form or separated cell form options.

How to make a cuboid maze:
input values for XYZ axes. These values determine how many "hallways/paths" there will be on each axis. X=10 means the maze will be 10 paths wide.

How to make a fill maze:
select a source object, set your desired definition (how many paths will cross the narrowest axis), execute.

You can select the option to generate the maze forms as, A) a bunch of cells (cubes) that form the maze, or B) a unified "hull", which is hollow inside, like me!

This tool is a dream come true for me, since I've been wanting a way to generate multi-level labyrinths of different shapes and sizes since I saw the maze-shape tool in MagicaVoxel a few years ago. Now I've spent a day building it, so you can just install it and use it without spending any money or effort - lucky you!!!

Installation:
-go into blender
-go to edit
-go to preferences
-go to addons
-hit install
-go to wherever you downloaded the ".py" file to
-click the file
-install

If you do end up using this tool for anything creative, please send me a screenshot, I want to see!
