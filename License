Indie developers can use this for personal or commercial projects, for free.
Corporate isn't allowed to use this for shit, unless they pay me $25,000 in gold.

If you do use this for anything, send me a screenshot, I'd love to see what you come up with. A little credit somewhere would be appreciated, too, since I spent a whole day working out how to make this work.
